/*
Metric: Active Users - Monthly

Definition:
The number of unique users who have had at least one payment transaction within a given month.

Interpretation:
Indicates the size of your engaged customer base. A growing number of active users suggests product stickiness and a healthy user ecosystem. This metric is crucial for understanding the overall reach and utilization of your service. It can be segmented further by product or country for deeper insights.
